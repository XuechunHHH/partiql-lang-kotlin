==== Rules

----
<LHS> <OP> <RHS>
----

> See SQL-99 Section 6.3

Let T~L~ and T~R~ be the types of the LHS and RHS respectively, and let S~L~ and S~R~ be their scales.


. If both T~L~ and T~R~ are exact numeric, the result is exact numeric.
.. For addition and subtraction, the scale of the result is MAX(S~L~, S~R~).
.. For multiplication, the scale of the result is S~L~ + S~R~.
.. For division, the scale is implementation defined.
.. For all operators, the precision is implementation-defined.

. If one of either T~L~ or T~R~ is approximate numeric, the result is approximate numeric.
. If one of the args is NULL, the result is NULL.
. Dividing by zero throws an exception.
